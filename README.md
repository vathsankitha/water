//TITLE:

"Water Usage Monitoring System"

//PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Many households and organisations do not have a systematic mechanism to monitor and analyse their water consumption.
Without regular tracking and alerts, excessive or inefficient usage goes unnoticed — resulting in water wastage, higher bills, potential leaks, and undermining sustainability efforts.

//PROPOSED SOLUTION:

Design a database‑driven system that:
Registers users (households or industries) with their details (user ID, name, address, type).
Logs water consumption records for each user on a daily/weekly/monthly basis (date, volume in litres).
Stores threshold guidelines for each user (e.g., expected monthly consumption for a household of X members).
Generates alerts when a user’s consumption exceeds the threshold (e.g., sends message, flags in system).
Supports queries and reporting such as:
Identify users who exceeded their threshold this month.
Trend of consumption per user (increasing/decreasing).
Comparison of consumption between users of the same type or region.
Helps users and administrators take action (e.g., detect leaks, encourage conservation behaviour, optimise usage).
